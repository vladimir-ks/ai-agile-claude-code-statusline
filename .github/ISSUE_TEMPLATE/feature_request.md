## Problem Statement

What problem or limitation would this feature address?

**Example**: "I want to track weekly spending, but the statusline only shows daily+hourly."

Describe your proposed solution clearly and concisely.

**Example**: "Add a 💰w field that shows weekly total spending ($127.50/week)"

## Alternatives Considered

Have you considered other solutions? Are there workarounds?

## Implementation Concerns

- Does this require background processes? (will be rejected)
- Does this add >5s latency? (will be rejected)
- Does this significantly increase code complexity?
- Will this break existing installations?

## Additional Context

- Why is this important to you?
- Are there similar features in other tools?
- How often would you use this?

**Note**: Features that require background processes, add significant latency, or diverge from core focus (cost tracking + monitoring) may not be accepted. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#improvement-ideas) for high-value contributions.
